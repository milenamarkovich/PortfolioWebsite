# About Me:

Hi! My name is Milena, I'm an Integrated Engineering student at the University of British Columbia. In my studies I focus on Mechanical and Computer engineering,
which allows me to combine my passions for aerospace engineering and computer programming. 

I am driven by a passion for learning, which is why I have continued growing my skills by joining design teams, such as UBC Rocket and UBC Mars Colony, and working 
on design projects which integrate software and hardware sensor components to deliver stakeholder-driven solutions. 

My experience ranges from object-oriented programming in Python, C++ and Java, front-end development in React and React Native (leveraging JavaScript and CSS), and embedded programming in C on Raspberry Pi systems. I also have experience working with Linux systems from previous internships and design projects. Throughout my time in aerospace I have also familiarized myself with TC and FAA guidelines surrounding design compliance of aircraft systems (i.e.: DO-178C, CARs Part 5, AC 43.13-1b).

I thrive in fast-paced, self-motivated environments and I love collaborating with others to create innovative solutions.
